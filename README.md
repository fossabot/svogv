## Introduction

Now that Angular 2 is widely used we have – the very first time in years – such a strong feeling in our guts that’s now the first step from ancient crap into something really professional. It brings the level we all know from Java and C# and the mature backend frameworks to the frontend. And it goes on. TypeScript is here and know we have something that’s an improvement for front end developers that matters:

TypeScript brings a whole new level to pros like us. And it makes our world easier – at least a bit. And it improves the quality of our product – not just a bit, a whole new step.

## What is it?

The approach was simply the usage of forms as simple as ever in Angular 2+. It's an extension to Angular 2+ that comes as a set of classes and components. The base project is called 'Forms' and makes the creation of forms as easy as possible (that means, you don't have to create anything, it's just created for you). And yes, complex forms and server driven stuff works, too.

The (currently) four projects are named like this:

* @svogv/forms: decorator or json driven forms and validation generator
* @svogv/blocks: a collection of widgets for all day use (needs @svogs/forms)
* @svogv/maps: a nice wrapper around Google's maps API (needs @svogs/forms)
* @svogv/hud: a fun project that consists of sci-fi Head Up display widgets

> Each project has it's own readme to get a quick start.

## Is there a roadmap?

Yes, at least a timeline:

* Split into the first two modules: 11/2017
* @svogv/forms: 12/2017
* @svogv/blocks and @svogv/maps: 03/2018
* @svogv/hud: 08/2018

## Can I contribute?

Yes, drop me an email with some "about me" stuff. Even simple feedback is appreciated.
