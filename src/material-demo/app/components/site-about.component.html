        <p>This project consists of several parts that can be used independently:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>A validation solution to automate form creation, based on decorators and editors</li>
            <li>A widget library for form components that use Bootstrap 4 as layout foundation</li>
            <li>A widget library based on SVG with some very special components</li>
        </ol>

            I'm going to treat this project as a starter for learning and experimenting. It's production ready anyway. A new project
            is under way, that has few improvements:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Validation, Form Widgets, and Components are going to be split</li>
            <li>A base path called @svogv is being created</li>
            <li>All design goes to Angular Material 2 and there is no Bootstrap anymore</li>
            <li>Additional quirks such as HUD and MAPS coming later but independently</li>
        </ul>
