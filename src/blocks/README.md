## Introduction

There are a lot of libraries, extensions, and packages for Angular available. This is just another one. It has, of course, a few special parts which I think other don't have. The intention was to have a package that helps developers of commercial products and intranet apps alike to create their stuff quickly and efficently.

## What is it?

This is the 'Block', short for 'Builing Blocks'. It's a collection of components designed for Angular including a set of styles for responsive designs. The underlying CSS lib is 'Neat', which is small and easy to use and avoids the addition of such big libs like Bootstrap. All styles are included in the components, that means, you can just start without adding more CSS. It's, of course, customizable.

The (currently) four projects are named like this:

* @svogv/forms: decorator or json driven forms and validation generator
* @svogv/blocks: a collection of widgets for all day use (needs @svogs/forms)
* @svogv/maps: a nice wrapper around Google's maps API (needs @svogs/forms)
* @svogv/hud: a fun project that consists of sci-fi Head Up display widgets

> This is the README f√ºr @svogv/blocks.

## Does it cost something?

It's ISC licensed and it's free. I deeply believe in Open Source and will support the ecosystem by open sourcing all parts of the project. For commerical users such as enterprises we have support options.

The SVOGV Widget Library was written by Joerg <isageek> Krause, www.joergkrause.de, Berlin / Germany. He has many years of experience with Web-Frameworks. He were in the business in the early JavaScript days, know every single bit in jQuery and learnt a lot about Knockout, Angular, and Durandal. But time goes on. So he moved almost all projects to either AngularJS or Angular 2+. He thinks that knowing one Framework really well is more for our customers than knowing a lot just good. So he decided to do more and start contributing to the Angular ecosystem by creating awesome libraries and components. 

## Can I contribute?

Yes, drop me an email with some "about me" stuff. Even simple feedback is appreciated.
